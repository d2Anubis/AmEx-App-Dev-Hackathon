# AmEx-App-Dev-Hackathon
American Express App Dev hackathon | Techgig<br/>
Requirements:<br/>
Please see the jupyter notebook code for understanding how to download the packages and run them.<br/>
The jupyter notebook can be easily uploaded on Google Colab and used there for free CPU and analysis. No settings and changes to the code are needed.<br/>

We have used the following technologies to make the project:<br/>
1. Twint : To extract data from twitter in large scale<br/>
2. PySpark : For big data processing of data and data analysis<br/>
3. Koalas : Its a wrapper on top of pyspark allowing pandas syntax to work with pyspark<br/>
4. Matplotlib and Seaborn : We used matplotllib and seaborn for plotting plots<br/>
5. Jupyter notebook : it allows interactive visualization and programming for working on data science projects<br/>
6. Google Colab : It is provided by Google for working with big datasets allowing high and free RAM and GPU<br/>
7. NLTK : It is a python package for natural language processing and sentiment analysis<br/>

One can run these on his own laptop but we would recommend to use Google Colab as it is fast and free to run the codes there. <br/>
Running the code on own laptop might lead to low memory.<br/>

Video link can be found in the presentation file. Since the video file was large we have uploaded it on Google drive.<br/>
